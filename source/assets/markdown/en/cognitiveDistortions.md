#### About the project

The main task was to form a neat and maintainable layout using OOCSS and Atomic CSS approaches.

It was further adapted for mobile devices.

It was implemented the ability to switch between the "light" and "dark" theme using JavaScript (DOM API).
A DARK switch was added to switch the theme, using animations and transformations in CSS.
